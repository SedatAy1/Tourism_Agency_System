## Homework Defination

Tourism Agency System
Patika Tourism Agency needs a structure in which it can run its business digitally. Assume that you have agreed with Patika for this digital infrastructure.

The working logic of Patika Tourism Agency is as follows: Hotels reserve certain rooms with Patika Tourism Agency and expect the agency to sell these rooms. When selling these rooms, the agency sells it to its customers by putting its own service fee as a percentage or a fixed price.

The agency thinks that doing these works on paper and manually is a waste of time, and needs a software that will make their job easier.

Expectation of the agency from the software:

Hotel management
The agency should manage the hotels it has contracted with, together with their location information and other features, from the system. While adding a hotel, other definitions such as Hotel Name, Address, E-mail, Telephone, Star, Facility Features, Hostel types are made.

Hostel Types expected to be in the system:
Ultra All Inclusive
All inclusive
Room breakfast
Full pension
Half board
Bed Only
Full credit without alcohol
Facility Features expected to be in the system:
Free Parking
Free WiFi
Swimming pool
Fitness Center
Hotel Concierge
SPA
24/7 Room Service
Sample Hotel Data;


Term Management
Historical periods of the hotels are added and pricing is made over these periods. The aim here is to offer a variable pricing. While hotel prices are higher in summer, this is less in winter. Pricing is made periodically in the tourism sector. Periods are defined as two date ranges.

Example Periods:

01/01/2021 - 31/05/2021
01/06/2021 - 01/12/2021
Room Management
The agency adds the rooms reserved from the hotels to the system and provides pricing on these rooms. Generally Single, Double, Suit etc. in hotels. There are certain room types, such as . It should also be entered in the properties of the rooms.

Television (Yes, No)
Minibar (Yes, No)
Game Console (Yes, No)
Square meters
Till

Sample Room Data;


Room Pricing
Rooms are calculated as per night rate. The prices are defined according to the hostel and adult child types over the periods added for the hotel.

Pricing expected in the system:
Prices are defined according to the nightly rates of the rooms. These prices include the agency's commission fee.

Room Search and Reservation Procedures
The agency employee should be able to search for a room according to the date range, Region or Hotels and guest information entered through the system.

Room Search Algorithm
After the agency enters the required room search information, it can list the rooms defined in the system.

For rooms to appear in the list:

The hotel of the room must be in the desired region.
According to the desired date range, the hotel should have period information. For example, for a search with Check-in Date: 09/06/2021 , Check-out Date: 12/06/2021, hotels must have a period in that date range.
If there is a period for the hotel, the room should also have price information according to the hostel types in the relevant periods so that price information can be given to the customer.
The stock number of the room must be greater than 0.
Example Search Data
Region : Beyoglu
Entry Date: 01/04/2021
Release Date: 03/04/2021
Guest Information: 2 Adults, 1 Child
Price Calculation

First, the hotels in the region are found.
There are rooms with stock belonging to the hotel found.
If the rooms have period price information in the relevant date range, the price calculation is made.

Reservation Process
The agency user completes the reservation by selecting the appropriate hostel type from the room types of the hotels he has listed.
